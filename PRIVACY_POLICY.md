# Privacy Policy for NH Bill Linker

**Effective Date:** January 2026

## Overview

NH Bill Linker is a Chrome extension designed to help users navigate New Hampshire legislative testimony forms. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What We Collect

- **URL Parameters**: The extension reads query string parameters (date, committee, bill, role, support) from the URL bar to auto-populate form fields. These parameters are processed only on pages under `https://gc.nh.gov/*`.
- **Chrome Storage**: User preferences and settings are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's `storage.sync` API.

### What We Do NOT Collect

- We do not transmit any data to external servers
- We do not collect personal information beyond what you explicitly provide via URL parameters
- We do not track your browsing behavior
- We do not use analytics or third-party tracking services

### Data Storage

All data is stored **locally on your device** using Chrome's built-in storage system. Your data remains:

- Private to your device
- Never sent to our servers or any third party
- Removed when you uninstall the extension

## Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions:

- **`storage`**: To save your user preferences locally
- **`host_permissions` for `https://gc.nh.gov/*`**: To access and modify form fields on New Hampshire legislative testimony pages

## Third-Party Code

This extension does not use any third-party libraries or services. It is built using only standard browser APIs.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy as the extension evolves. Any changes will be reflected in the extension's version history.

## Questions?

If you have concerns about this extension's privacy practices, please open an issue on the project repository.
